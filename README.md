# Unfolding Orthogonal Polyhedra

This is an implementation of [this paper](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-48971-0_36), which unfolds orthogonal polyhedra of at most genus 0.

to run sample:

1. ```cd src```

2. ```cd python main.py ../data/samples/test_case5.fold```


# NOTE: requires OpenGL. 
If on windows, you probably need to recompile the viewer. ==================
Current executable in ./viewer/build is for Mac
Build Instructions for Viewer: (while in ./viewer)

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
